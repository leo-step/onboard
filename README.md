Learning a new codebase is tough-- whether you're a new hire at a company or trying to contribute to an open-source repository, getting used to a new tech stack for the first couple weeks of a project is often confusing. But, what if you could fix this-- what if there was an app to teach you any GitHub repository's tech stack?

Onboard is a generative AI-powered development tool that teaches programmers to quickly become contributors to any new codebase-- period. Given any respository, Onboard generates fill in the blank coding questions on existing code; users are interactively guided through these exercises, empowering with the fundamental knowledge of how the libraries and functions in their codebase work. For creating exerices, Onboard strategically selects files from the repository that maximize user learning-- users must complete fill in the blanks for at least 10 files to finish their training.

Users are asked to fill-in-the-blanks on existing code in a GitHub repository; every time our program is run, our development tool generates completely new questions for the user; for each file the user can get up to 15 hints.

To get started, enter any public GitHub repository - happy learning!
