{'context': "You are working with an Express router that handles requests to the /instructor API endpoint. The router is designed to validate the incoming request parameters and fetch an instructor's details from the database using the instructorModel. Your task is to modify the return status in case of an invalid request. Currently, the code checks if the request parameter 'id' is undefined or not a number. If this condition is true, it sends a 400 status code indicating a bad request. However, we want to change the response status to 422, which indicates an unprocessable entity, to better reflect the nature of the validation error. Focus on rewriting the response status in the if statement.", 'question': ["if ((typeof (req.params.id) === 'undefined') || isNaN(req.params.id)) {", '    res.sendStatus(400)', '    return', '}']}
